# An Undertale Engine

## About
Equuleus (pronounced ihk-woo-lee-us) is a free and open source Undertale Engine
for Windows, MacOS, and Linux made using the Godot Engine. The name comes from
the Latin word for "little horse," and represents the second smallest
constellation. The name has no particular meaning to the project, but was chosen
just because it sounds cool (why not?).

As of the last update, the project is still in a VERY early status, so it is
currently unusable for actual fangames until most of the main battle engine is
finished. We intend for full use of Undertale's capabilities, and even more
additions as well to increase the ease of use. We also intend for a full easy
editor so that fangame creators don't have to take the time to sort through this
projects code to figure out what they want to do. Plus, everyone doesn't use
Godot, do they?

## Contribution
Yes, we (as in only me) are in need of help! I am a single programmer without a 
whole lot of time (and experience) on my hands to work on this project. I will 
also need help working on the design for this, like the logo and custom sprites
(if we decide to drop the old ones).

You can contribute via pull requests. ANY pull requests are welcome. You may
write documentation, rewrite this README file, fix my bad code, work on tasks,
create tasks, import assets, and so on. If there's anything in the project that
you think needs work on, then GO AHEAD. It is appreciated.
